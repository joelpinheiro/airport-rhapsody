/**
 *  \brief Definition of the superblock data type.
 *
 *  It contains global information about the file system layout, namely the size and the location of the remaining
 *  parts.
 *
 *  It is divided in:
 *     \li <em>header</em> - that contains data about the type, the version, the name, the size in number of physical
 *         blocks and the consistency status
 *     \li <em>inode table metadata</em> - concerning its location, size in number of blocks, total number of inodes and
 *         number of free inodes; the inode table is primarily conceived as an array of inodes, however, the free inodes
 *         form a double-linked circular list whose insertion and retrieval points are also provided (dynamic linear FIFO
 *         that links together all the free inodes, using the inodes themselves as nodes)
 *     \li <em>cluster-to-inode mapping table</em> - concerning its location and size in number of blocks; the cluster-to-
 *         inode mapping table is conceived as an array of references to inodes which expresses the connection of each
 *         data cluster, when allocated, to the file object it belongs to; it is instrumental to the recovery of previous
 *         deleted files and to enhance the determination of consistency of the file system and to provide means for its
 *         repairing
 *     \li <em>data zone metadata</em> - concerning its location, size in total number of data clusters, number of free
 *         data clusters and its three main reference components: the insertion and retrieval caches for a fast temporary
 *         storage of references (static structures resident within the superblock itself) and the location, size in number
 *         of blocks and search point index of the bitmap table to free data clusters, organized as an array of bits each
 *         pointing to the status of allocation of the corresponding data cluster (the search for a free data cluster should
 *         proceed in a circular way always starting at the search point index).
