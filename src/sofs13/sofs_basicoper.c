/**

 *
 *  \brief Set of operations to manage the file system internal data structures.
 *
 *
 *  The aim is to provide an unique storage location when the file system is in operation.
 *
 *  The operations are:
 *      \li load the contents of the superblock into internal storage
 *      \li get a pointer to the contents of the superblock
 *      \li store the contents of the superblock resident in internal storage to the storage device
 *      \li convert the inode number, which translates to an entry of the table of inodes, into the logical number (the
 *          ordinal, starting at zero, of the succession blocks that the table of inodes comprises) and the offset of
 *          the block where it is stored
 *      \li load the contents of a specific block of the table of inodes into internal storage
 *      \li get a pointer to the contents of a specific block of the table of inodes
 *      \li store the contents of the block of the table of inodes resident in internal storage to the storage device
 *      \li convert the reference of an entry to the table of cluster-to-inode mapping into the logic number and offset
 *          of the block where it is stored
 *      \li load the contents of a specific block of the table of cluster-to-inode mapping into internal storage
 *      \li get a pointer to the contents of a specific block of the table of cluster-to-inode mapping
 *      \li store the contents of the block of the table of cluster-to-inode mapping resident in internal storage to
 *          the storage device
 *      \li convert the reference to a data cluster, which translates to an entry of the bitmap table to free data clusters,
 *          into the logical number (the ordinal, starting at zero, of the succession blocks that the bitmap table to free
 *          data clusters comprises), the byte offset of the block where it is stored and the bit offset within the byte
 *      \li load the contents of a specific block of the bitmap table to free data clusters into internal storage
 *      \li get a pointer to the contents of a specific block of the bitmap table to free data clusters
 *      \li store the contents of the block of the bitmap table to free data clusters resident in internal storage
 *          to the storage device
 *      \li convert the logical number (the ordinal, starting at zero, of the succession blocks that the bitmap table to
 *          free data clusters comprises), the byte offset of the block where it is stored and the bit offset within the
 *          byte to a reference to a data cluster
 *      \li convert a byte position in the data continuum (information content) of a file, into the index of the element
 *          of the list of direct references and the offset within it where it is stored
 *      \li load the contents of a specific cluster of the table of single indirect references to data clusters into
 *          internal storage.
 *      \li get a pointer to the contents of a specific cluster of the table of single indirect references to data
 *          clusters
 *      \li store the contents of a specific cluster of the table of single indirect references to data clusters
 *          resident in internal storage to the storage device
 *      \li load the contents of a specific cluster of the table of direct references to data clusters into internal
 *          storage
 *      \li get a pointer to the contents of a specific cluster of the table of direct references to data clusters
 *      \li store the contents of a specific cluster of the table of direct references to data clusters resident in
 *          internal storage to the storage device.
